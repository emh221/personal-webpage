                <p>I was born in Oregon City, Oregon. I graduated from University of Portland, with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Spanish. I am currently working at Nike as a DevOps engineer. Prior to that I worked as a professional fly fishing guide for 7 years in Alaska. My experience also includes many growing seasons on my family's grain and cattle farm in North Dakota. I am capable of solving problems of <span class="allkinds">all kinds!</span></p> <!-- Span is in place only to meet project requirements. I KNOW ABOUT EM TAGS!!-->

              <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Cloud Infrastructure</em></strong> - I enjoy using Terraform and Cloudformation to provision and create cloud resources. I love the challenge offered by the dynamic nature and broad scope of this work and the detail-oriented approach the work requires.</li>
		<br>
                 <li><strong><em>Container Orchestration</em></strong> - The reusability, scalability, and portability of containers excites me as a DevOps engineer. I am very familiar with AWS's ECS offering and am eager to learn more about Kubernetes and the benefits it offers.</li>
                <br>
		<li><strong><em>Automation Tools</em></strong> - The benefits of properly implementing CI/CD are enormous. I am enthusiastic about using tools like Jenkins for build automation to help teams and engineers produce high quality code that can be released to production sooner.</li>
